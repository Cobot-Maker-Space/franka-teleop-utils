# franka-teleop-utils

Basic utility applications to support projects using Franka Emika Robots (n√©e Panda), focused mostly around teleoperation tasks. This is very much a work-in-progress.

## Requirements

* [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) - Version 3.x.
* [libfranka](https://github.com/frankaemika/libfranka) - Version 0.9.2.
* [CapnProto](https://capnproto.org/)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org) - Version 3.5.0 or greater.

## Building

* Create a directory in the source folder, e.g., `mkdir build`.
* Change to the build directory, `cd build`.
* Run cmake on the source, `cmake ..`.
* Run make to build the source, `make`.

## Core (C++) Components

### Publisher (publisher.cpp)

Publishes joint states and velocities from an arm.

### Subscriber (subscriber.cpp)

Listens for updates from a publisher and attempts to apply the joint states to
the connected arm.

### PublisherSubscriber (publisher_subscriber.cpp)

Simulataneously publishes state whilst listening for and applying joint states.

### Grasp (grasp.cpp)

Causes the gripper to grasp an object.

### Release (release.cpp)

Causes the gripper to release any grasped object.

### Teleop Utils (teleop_utils.cpp)

Common code for other components.

## Message Format

[CapnProto](https://capnproto.org/) is used for message serialisation/deserialisation
during transmission and recording. See [messages/robot-state.capnp](messages/robot-state.capnp) for the message structure. Each message is 136 bytes.

## Configuration

See `config.yml` for the full configuration. The utilities above accept the name of a configuration file with the `-c` parameter.

### Configuration Paramters

* send
  * host: IP address to send to
  * port: Port to send to
  * rate: Rate in Hz to attempt to send data at
* receive
  * host: IP address to receive on (0.0.0.0 for all local addresses)
  * port: Port to receive on
  * multicast_host: Multicast host to receive on (optional)
* robot:
  * host: Robot IP address
  * autorecovery:
  * enabled: Boolean, true to enable autorecovery
  * wait_time_ms: Time in milliseconds to wait before auto recovering

## Utility Scripts

These scripts were written quickly for the Embrace Angels contemporary deployment. A lot of values are hard-coded so some care will need to be taken when running them.

### convert.py

Takes a Cap'n'Proto encoded recording file and dumps it to CSV.

### kplayer.py

Takes a CSV file of joint positions (no header) and plays it back on an arm that is in subscriber mode.

### player.py

Used for Embrace Angels, takes two recordings and plays them back, one on each arm.

### recorder.py

Used for Embrace Angels, makes recordings from both arms.
Command line arguments:

* -i / --iface: Network interface to listen on
* -a / --addr: Your IP address to listen on
* -m / -maddr: Multicast address to listen on

TODO: These values should be read from a configuration file, and in the case of interface name and IP address, automatically discovered.
